 Daikibo Factory Downtime Analysis — Task 1 (Deloitte Australia Job Simulation)

This project was completed as part of the **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation** on Forage.  
In Task 1, I analyzed telemetry data provided by **:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}** to understand factory-level machine downtime and device performance issues across four global locations.

The objective was to build an **interactive Tableau dashboard** capable of answering:
- Which factory had the highest machine downtime?
- Which machine types contributed the most to unhealthy events?
- How can telemetry-based insights guide operational decision-making?

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used
- **Tableau Desktop**
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- **Calculated Fields** (10-minute downtime per “Unhealthy” event)
- **Interactive Dashboard Design**
- **Operational Analytics & Insight Generation**

## 📌 Key Insights from Task 1
- **Daikibo Factory Seiko** reported the highest downtime among all units.
- Machine types such as **LaserWelder** and **LaserCutter** showed the largest number of unhealthy events.
- The use of calculated fields simplified downtime measurement, with each “Unhealthy” log representing **10 minutes** of non-functional machine time.
- The final dashboard allows managers to compare factories and drill down into machine-based inefficiencies quickly.
